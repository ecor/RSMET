MeteoIO is a C/C++ OPen source library which "has been designed to accomodate both the needs of carefully crafted simulations for a specific purpose/study and for the needs of operational simulations that run automatically and unattended". It is integrated in physical spatially-distributed models and tackles several issues with weather input/output data. Here is a SMET S4 opject is defined and can be imported from/ exported to a SMET ini files of MeteoIO , allowing interoperability from R to MeteoIO and other SMET-compliant software.
