Title: Get Real-Time Meteorological Data in SMET Format
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano
Description: It manages snow and weather local time series as provided by MeteoIO (<http://models.slf.ch/docserver/meteoio/html/index.html>, <http://www.slf.ch/ueber/organisation/schnee_permafrost/projekte/MeteoIO/index_EN>, <https://www.openhub.net/p/MeteoIO>). MeteoIO is a C/C++ Open Source library which "has been designed to accomodate both the needs of carefully crafted simulations for a specific purpose/study and for the needs of operational simulations that run automatically and unattended". It is integrated in physical spatially-distributed models and tackles several issues with weather input/output data. Here a SMET S4 class object is defined and can be imported from/ exported to a SMET ini files of MeteoIO , allowing interoperability from R to MeteoIO and other SMET-compliant software.
